# Title: Where do you want to go?

## What and why?
An app that will find popular hangout spots/food spots in the city of choice. It can be difficult planning a hangout if you don't have somewhere you already want to go, or if everyone has differing tastes, so the app can help users plan a date or hangout with their peers with ease

## For whom?
This app would be useful for anyone wanting to plan a hangout or date but are not sure where they want to go. 

## How?
The app will receive data about popular spots around the city from other websites such as Yelp or Google. The user can specify how many activities/ food spots they would like the app to pick out. The app will generate a link that can be sent to the users, who can then pick the activities or foods that they are interested in. The app would then go through all these selections and find the ones that the users have in common (or the most agreed upon choices) and generate a customized plan for the group. 

## Scope
I believe this project would be suitable for a 4-6 programmer team.  There are many features that can be added if time allows for it.
